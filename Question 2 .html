    <!-- What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? -->

    <!-- Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. 
        
        Containers are used to contain, padding, and (sometimes) center the content within them. 
        
        While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container. 
    
        
        => There are two container classes in bootstrap which is below.

        1)  The class container

        2)  The class container-fluid
    
    

        =>  .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
        =>  .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
        =>  .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

        =>  Use .container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
