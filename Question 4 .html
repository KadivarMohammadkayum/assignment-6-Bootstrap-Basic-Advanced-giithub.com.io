    <!-- What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System? -->

    <!--=>  Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and align content. 
        
        =>  It's built with flexbox and is fully responsive.

        =>  Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

        =>  If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns
